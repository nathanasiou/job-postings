# Data Scientist Job Posting Analysis
The web scraping, preprocessing, and visualization of data scientist job posting data gives insight for salary expectations for hybrid, remote, and in-person roles.

## Project Motivation
For this project, I wanted to practice web-scraping with Python and visualizing data with PowerBI while considering salaries as a job searcher.

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The code should run with the Anaconda distribution of Python and Python versions 3.* . Make sure you install the necessary libraries -- pandas, re, and selenium.

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
Thank you to Indeed for the job postings, stackoverflow for being an indispensable resource in any project, and my dear friend Reed Nelson for inspiring me with his commitment to personal projects and growth.
